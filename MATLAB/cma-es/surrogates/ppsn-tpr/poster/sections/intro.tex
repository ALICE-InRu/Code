\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item The aim is to reduce the number of costly fitness
  evaluations needed in evolutionary computing.
\item The fitness of individual points is indirectly estimated
  by modeling their rank using \emph{ordinal regression or kernel
  based preference learning}.
\item A generic framework for surrogate ranking using ordinal
regression in evolutionary computation is presented. 
\item The formulation does not need an explicitly defined
  fitness function, making it suitable for {\bf co-evolution} and
  {\bf interactive evolution}.
\end{itemize}
