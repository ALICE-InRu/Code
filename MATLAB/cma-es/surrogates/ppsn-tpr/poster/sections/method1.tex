\section{Ordinal Regression}

The ranking problem is specified by a set $S =
\{(\vec{x}_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^\ell \subset X \times Y$ of point/rank
pairs, where $Y=\{r_1,\ldots,r_\ell\}$ is the outcome space with
ordered ranks $r_1> r_2,> \ldots > r_\ell$.

\ \\ 
In ordinal regression the task is to obtain a function  that
can for a given pair $(\vec{x}_i,y_i)$ and $(\vec{x}_j,y_j)$
distinguish between two different outcomes: $y_i > y_j$ and $y_j
> y_i$.

\ \\
The training set is as follows:
$$S' = \big\{(\vec{x}_k^{(1)},
\vec{x}_k^{(2)}),t_k=\text{sign}(y_k^{(1)} -
y_k^{(2)})\big\}_{k=1}^{\ell'}$$
where $(y_k^{(1)} = r_i) \wedge
(y_k^{(2)} = r_{i+1})$ (and vice versa $(y_k^{(1)} = r_{i+1})
\wedge (y_k^{(2)} = r_{i})$) resulting in $\ell'=2(\ell-1)$
possible adjacently ranked training pairs. The rank difference
is denoted by $t_k\in[-1,1]$.

\ \\
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used on the above training
data.
