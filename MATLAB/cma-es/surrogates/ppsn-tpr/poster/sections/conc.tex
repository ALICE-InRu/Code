\section{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
\item First time surrogate ranking is used in evolutionary computing.
\item Reduces the number of fitness evaluations needed
  during evolution.
\item Can be applied to more abstract data types as long as a
  kernel can be defined, for example a tree kernel for GP.
\item May be sensitive to the model selected and training set size.
\item Currently the author is applying the technique to Pareto
  ranking for multi-objective optimization.
\end{itemize}
