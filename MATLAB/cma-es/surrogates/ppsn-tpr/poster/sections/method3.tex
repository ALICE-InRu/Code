\begin{enumerate}
\item Estimate the ranking of a population of points of unknown
  fitness using the current surrogate. Let the point with the
  highest ranking be a test point, $\vec{x}_t$. Rank this test
  point with respect to the points in the training set using the
  current surrogate.
\item Evaluate the test point using the true fitness function
  and evaluate its true rank among the training points.
\item Compare the rankings by computing the rank
  correlation $\tau_k$ (Kendall's $\tau$) for the ranking in 1 and 2.
\item Add this new point to the training set.
\item If $\tau_k$ is equal to $1$ the model is said to be
  sufficiently accurate. This is a simple cross-validation
on a single test point.
\item If $\tau_k < 1$ the model is not sufficiently accurate. In
  this case update the surrogate using the new training set.
  Repeated the steps above until $\tau=1$ or all points of
  unknown fitness have been evaluated.
\end{enumerate}
